##  :beginner: About
Featuring home, personal, and social modules ranging from shared expenditures tracking to division of chores, Casa is an app that brings people living together, together. Through Casa, I gained a much deeper understanding of the importance of software architecture, eventually settling on using Business Logic Components (BLoC) pattern and incorporating core principles of Domain Driven Design. It is currently a work in progress.
